  <h3 class="card-title">Why use data2paper?</h3>
  <p>Data2paper is a cloud-based application to automate the process of compiling and submitting a data paper to a journal without the researcher having to leave the research space or wrestle directly with the journalâ€™s submission system.</p>
  <p>Metadata from your repository dataset is transfered to Data2paper and is available in your dashboard as a data paper. Visit the data paper entry, select a journal, compose the data paper, upload it and submit it to the journal</p>
